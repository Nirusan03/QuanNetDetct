*) Create TLS network - last plan
*) Introduce anomalies
   0) Filter the non-anomaly and anomaly network traffic.
   ii) Select the tls based features with a specific dataset, and non anomaly or anomaly.
   iii) Plot and see the dataset points of anomaly datapoints.
   iv) Introduce the anomaly datapoint to the new tls traffic dataset.

Two solutions I can go with:
1. Mail to isala about the findings about darknet and Cesnet dataset (say this ds does not cointains anomaly).
2. Ask how to scope down project.

================

*) Go with initial port selection i have done.
*) Classifying what kind of traffic it is in the darknet dataset - Tor, non-tor, vpn.
*) Train the dataset with cic 2018 and for real world testing use cisnet dataset.
