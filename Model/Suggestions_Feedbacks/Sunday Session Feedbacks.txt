*) Create TLS network - last plan
*) Introduce anomalies
   0) Filter the non-anomaly and anomaly network traffic.
   ii) Select the tls based features with a specific dataset, and non anomaly or anomaly.
   iii) Plot and see the dataset points of anomaly datapoints.
   iv) Introduce the anomaly datapoint to the new tls traffic dataset.

Two solutions I can go with:
1. Mail to isala about the findings about darknet and Cesnet dataset (say this ds does not cointains anomaly).
2. Ask how to scope down project.

================

*) Go with initial port selection i have done.
*) Classifying what kind of traffic it is in the darknet dataset - Tor, non-tor, vpn.
*) Train the dataset with cic 2018 and for real world testing use cisnet dataset.

=============================


*) Validate the cluster based smote by checking the vast of the data points before applying smote.
   - Plots are better (DNS, LDAP, SYN)

*) Do the feature importance validation to each attack (for the feature selection) before moving on the feature selection on QNN model.
   Do the feature importance plot to the smote dataset as well. 

   Comparing them and validate

*) Add the benchmarking validation in lr also explain in words at the testing chapter (7).
